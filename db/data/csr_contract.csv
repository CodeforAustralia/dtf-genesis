This may be harsh, given the numberof areas that the contractor scored good & satisfactory. I recommend that I consuct a meeting with the contractor to discuss his performance and follow up the meeting by issuing him a letter putting the contractor on notice that any future poor performance reports could result with him being removed from the doi register.     Due to the shortage of contractors within the Geelong area & Derbys Builders previous satisfactory performance over the past years, I am reluctant to have the contractor removed from the register without giving him the opportunity to improve his performance on the three current contracts that he was with the department.  -  Steve Sullivan - Senior Project Manager Asset Improvement North West.",82191736781,117144,T,General Upgrade - Collingwood / Northcote areas.,Collingwood/Northcote,,"$493,320.00 ",,2001/07/10,2001/12/31,,85028336782,95159,T,D&C Dwellings on Various Sites in Watsonia,Watsonia,,"$727,345.00 ",,2000/03/21,2000/10/25,,80933036783,123149,T,"Villa Upgrades - Hastings, Frankston Area",Hastings,,"$177,021.00 ",Housing,2004/03/17,2004/06/10,,85234336784,TBA,S,Demolitions,Geelong,,"$25,000.00 ",,,,,84502836785,122669,S,Drainage Rectification,,,,,,,,80612336945,122669,S,Drainage Rectification,,,,,,,,80612337292,106250,T,4 one BR older persons units,,,"$256,180.00 ",,2000/03/29,2000/12/01,,81991737307,98496,T,8 one BR Older persons units,,,"$421,997.00 ",,1999/08/16,2000/06/14,,83987337309,117304,S,"1x1 and 1x2 BR older persons units,",,,"$14,900.00 ",,,,,80546937310,107561,T,2 Units,Wantirna,,"$259,699.00 ",,1999/04/14,1999/11/10,,80902137311,107561,T,2 Units,Wantirna,,"$259,699.00 ",,1999/04/14,1999/11/10,,80902137312,104163,T,3 Units,Watsonia,,"$229,101.00 ",,1998/12/22,1999/05/25,,80933037314,104163,T,3 Units,Watsonia,,"$229,101.00 ",,1998/12/22,1999/05/25,,80933037315,98689,T,H&L Units,,,"$1,075,484.00 ",,1998/09/10,1998/11/27,,80932537319,98689,T,H&L Units,,,"$1,075,484.00 ",,1998/09/10,1998/11/27,,80932537320,98575,T,6 Units Various Mildura area,Mildura Area,,"$444,486.00 ",,1998/06/24,1999/12/22,,82099037325,98575,T,6 Units Various Mildura area,Mildura Area,,"$444,486.00 ",,1998/06/24,1999/12/22,,82099037326,102628,T,4 x Units,Footscray,,"$327,500.00 ",,1998/10/09,1999/08/04,,80933037327,102628,T,4 x Units,Footscray,,"$327,500.00 ",,1998/10/09,1999/08/04,,80933037328,98541,T,Units in Woori Yallock,Woori Yallock,,"$365,823.00 ",,1998/11/02,1999/05/17,,85062437328,98712,T,5 x H&L units in Narre Warren and in Hampton Park.,Hampton Park and Narre Warren,,"$378,051.00 ",,1998/10/02,1999/03/23,,85064037329,98609,T,8 H&L Units,Mulgrave,,"$743,116.00 ",,1998/06/06,1998/02/22,,80902137330,98609,T,8 H&L Units,Mulgrave,,"$743,116.00 ",,1998/06/06,1998/02/22,,80902137331,102762,T,8 H & L Units @ Mulgrave,Mulgrave,,"$733,557.00 ",,1999/04/20,1999/02/22,,80902137331,102606,T,4 x House & Land Package Units,Wangaratta & Wodonga,,"$262,197.00 ",,1998/10/29,1999/02/12,,84936337332,98776,T,26 H&L Units,Various,,"$2,103,462.00 ",,1999/01/14,1999/06/21,,80243137333,102824,T,3x H&L Units in Wodonga,Wodonga,,"$182,893.00 ",,1998/11/12,1999/03/29,,81651237343,98741,T,"3x4 and 2x3 BR H&L at Korumburra, Lakes Entrance and Sale.","Korumburra, Lakes Ent, & Sale",,"$445,593.00 ",,1998/12/08,1999/04/28,,80902137344,98741,T,"3x4 and 2x3 BR H&L at Korumburra, Lakes Entrance and Sale.","Korumburra, Lakes Ent, & Sale",,"$445,593.00 ",,1998/12/08,1999/04/28,,80902137345,128427,T,MNT,Ringwood,,"$102,743.00 ",,2003/01/18,2003/03/21,,81173137346,128427,T,MNT,Ringwood,,"$102,743.00 ",,2003/01/18,2003/03/21,,81173137349,116999,S,"1x2, 1x3 & 1x4 BR Family units",,,"$30,000.00 ",,2000/10/25,2003/01/01,,80502037358,125735,S,3 Development sites in Braybrook and Maidstone Area's.,Braybrook & Maidstone Areas,,"$30,550.00 ",,2002/06/01,2003/08/01,,84651037367,133802,S,Foyer Upgrade 150 Victoria Ave - Albert Park.,Albert Park,,,,,,,80525337374,134913,S,Upgrade of 8th Floor flats at 12 Sutton St - Nth Melbourne,Nth Melbourne,,"$13,200.00 ",,,,,80519937375,131687,T,Villa upgrades and programmed mnt,Ascot Vale,,"$260,458.00 ",,,,,81032537378,132264,T,"Upgrade works to 21 Apartments, Prahran & Elsternwick Area",Prahran,,"$373,769.00 ",Housing,2004/03/16,2004/09/03,,81353637379,134179,T,"Fire reinstatement, 4A walsh street Noble Park. - Dandenong Area",Dandenong,,"$55,382.00 ",,,,,85234337386,134179,T,"Fire reinstatement, 4A walsh street Noble Park. - Dandenong Area",Dandenong,,"$55,382.00 ",,,,,85234337388,134255,T,"Neighbourhood Renewal, stage 1.

Traditional Builders did not appear to control their sub-contracots well enough such that the works dragged on especially the re-mortaring of the unit paving joints at the front of the units which was only completed this morning.  It has taken a few months to carry out this particular work, which should have only taken a few days at most.  In addition, the tenant at 91 Campbell St,  Collingwood became very agitated with the quality of the work carried out to that particular unit especially the internal painting, and Traditional Builders was not vry pro-active in appeasing the tenant such that a lot of time was lost and wasted in the process.  In addition, the tender amount for the works was $105K which is a substantial amount of money.
