This may be harsh, given the numberof areas that the contractor scored good & satisfactory. I recommend that I consuct a meeting with the contractor to discuss his performance and follow up the meeting by issuing him a letter putting the contractor on notice that any future poor performance reports could result with him being removed from the doi register.     Due to the shortage of contractors within the Geelong area & Derbys Builders previous satisfactory performance over the past years, I am reluctant to have the contractor removed from the register without giving him the opportunity to improve his performance on the three current contracts that he was with the department.  -  Steve Sullivan - Senior Project Manager Asset Improvement North West."36541,117144,850283,T,General Upgrade - Collingwood / Northcote areas.,Collingwood/Northcote,,"$493,320.00 ",,2001/07/10,2001/12/31,36542,95159,809330,T,D&C Dwellings on Various Sites in Watsonia,Watsonia,,"$727,345.00 ",,2000/03/21,2000/10/25,36543,123149,852343,T,"Villa Upgrades - Hastings, Frankston Area",Hastings,,"$177,021.00 ",Housing,2004/03/17,2004/06/10,36544,TBA,845028,S,Demolitions,Geelong,,"$25,000.00 ",,,,36545,122669,806123,S,Drainage Rectification,,,,,,,36546,106250,819917,T,4 one BR older persons units,,,"$256,180.00 ",,2000/03/29,2000/12/01,36547,98496,839873,T,8 one BR Older persons units,,,"$421,997.00 ",,1999/08/16,2000/06/14,36548,117304,805469,S,"1x1 and 1x2 BR older persons units,",,,"$14,900.00 ",,,,36549,107561,809021,T,2 Units,Wantirna,,"$259,699.00 ",,1999/04/14,1999/11/10,36550,104163,809330,T,3 Units,Watsonia,,"$229,101.00 ",,1998/12/22,1999/05/25,36551,98689,809325,T,H&L Units,,,"$1,075,484.00 ",,1998/09/10,1998/11/27,36552,98575,820990,T,6 Units Various Mildura area,Mildura Area,,"$444,486.00 ",,1998/06/24,1999/12/22,36553,102628,809330,T,4 x Units,Footscray,,"$327,500.00 ",,1998/10/09,1999/08/04,36554,98541,850624,T,Units in Woori Yallock,Woori Yallock,,"$365,823.00 ",,1998/11/02,1999/05/17,36555,98712,850640,T,5 x H&L units in Narre Warren and in Hampton Park.,Hampton Park and Narre Warren,,"$378,051.00 ",,1998/10/02,1999/03/23,36556,98609,809021,T,8 H&L Units,Mulgrave,,"$743,116.00 ",,1998/06/06,1998/02/22,36557,102762,809021,T,8 H & L Units @ Mulgrave,Mulgrave,,"$733,557.00 ",,1999/04/20,1999/02/22,36558,102606,849363,T,4 x House & Land Package Units,Wangaratta & Wodonga,,"$262,197.00 ",,1998/10/29,1999/02/12,36559,98776,802431,T,26 H&L Units,Various,,"$2,103,462.00 ",,1999/01/14,1999/06/21,36560,102824,816512,T,3x H&L Units in Wodonga,Wodonga,,"$182,893.00 ",,1998/11/12,1999/03/29,36561,98741,809021,T,"3x4 and 2x3 BR H&L at Korumburra, Lakes Entrance and Sale.","Korumburra, Lakes Ent, & Sale",,"$445,593.00 ",,1998/12/08,1999/04/28,36562,128427,811731,T,MNT,Ringwood,,"$102,743.00 ",,2003/01/18,2003/03/21,36563,116999,805020,S,"1x2, 1x3 & 1x4 BR Family units",,,"$30,000.00 ",,2000/10/25,2003/01/01,36564,125735,846510,S,3 Development sites in Braybrook and Maidstone Area's.,Braybrook & Maidstone Areas,,"$30,550.00 ",,2002/06/01,2003/08/01,36565,133802,805253,S,Foyer Upgrade 150 Victoria Ave - Albert Park.,Albert Park,,,,,,36567,134913,805199,S,Upgrade of 8th Floor flats at 12 Sutton St - Nth Melbourne,Nth Melbourne,,"$13,200.00 ",,,,36607,131687,810325,T,Villa upgrades and programmed mnt,Ascot Vale,,"$260,458.00 ",,,,36613,132264,813536,T,"Upgrade works to 21 Apartments, Prahran & Elsternwick Area",Prahran,,"$373,769.00 ",Housing,2004/03/16,2004/09/03,36614,134179,852343,T,"Fire reinstatement, 4A walsh street Noble Park. - Dandenong Area",Dandenong,,"$55,382.00 ",,,,36616,134255,847190,T,"Neighbourhood Renewal, stage 1.

""Letter from Superintendant' = The remedial works at the above property have FINALLY been completed.  As discussed, we have rated Traditional Builders as poor according to the contractor performance report.  The works took way too long to be completed due to a variety of reasons.  Traditional Builders did not appear to control their sub-contracots well enough such that the works dragged on especially the re-mortaring of the unit paving joints at the front of the units which was only completed this morning.  It has taken a few months to carry out this particular work, which should have only taken a few days at most.  In addition, the tenant at 91 Campbell St,  Collingwood became very agitated with the quality of the work carried out to that particular unit especially the internal painting, and Traditional Builders was not vry pro-active in appeasing the tenant such that a lot of time was lost and wasted in the process.  In addition, the tender amount for the works was $105K which is a substantial amount of money.

Examples of such are recorded in minutes of site meetings.ÌÁ	Dilapidation reports - while in general the submissions of dilapidation reports/photos have been satisfactory, Transpacific have not yet submitted 'post-works' reports of the ground level roof structures beneath drops where works were undertaken despite their commitments made during site meetings.ÌÁ	Trial repairs - not all trial repair documentation has been received for this Contract.  While photos and trial repairs were confirmed to have been taken during site inspections by Foremen on site, necessary documentation has not been submitted to the Superintendent's Representative.  Such delays in submissions of trial repair documentation are recorded in meeting minutes.ÌÁ	Warranties - significant delays were experienced in receiving both Contractor and Material warranties for either building of this Contract.  These were predominantly due to errors contained in the documents submitted; and as stated by Transpacific, delays in their receipt of the Material warranties from Parchem.QualityÌÁ	Despite the quality of works observed during weekly inspections being generally satisfactory, as outlined in Administration & Documentation, Transpacific at times did not have complete documentation and paperwork as required by their Quality Management Plan.ÌÁ	Aggregate balcony panels at 127 Gordon St, Footscray - the appearance of external repairs on aggregate balcony panels at 127 Gordon St, Footscray do not strictly meet the aesthetic requirements of the specification as they are visible from ground level."65828,157534,901529,T,1342-30559 -
